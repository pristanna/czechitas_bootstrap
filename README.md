I learnt how to create responsive websites using the Bootstrap framework.

During the course I created a complex web page that adapts to the size of the browser, so it is usable on a mobile phone, tablet and computer.

You can see a preview of the webpage [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/pristanna/czechitas_bootstrap/blob/main/Projekt/index.html#reference).
